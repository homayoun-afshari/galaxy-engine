Galaxy Engine is a two-dimensional gravity simulator based on <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>. This simulator is part of an educational web application, trying to provide a minimal interactive demonstration of how gravity works in large scales. The simulator is written in JavaScript and is compatible with all the modern browsers. However, Galaxy Engine is not just a humble simulator! It is a complete web application. In the following I explain it in more detail.

# Code Structure

## Backend

The backend script, [galaxy.js](galaxy.js), contains 3 main components; the `Projectile` class is responsible for any physical object inside the simulator; the `galaxy` object controls the simulatorâ€™s behavior; and the `physics` function is where the magic happens! The coding is descriptive and different blocks are labeled properly.

## Front-End

The front-end script, [main.js](main.js), contains manages the GUI behavior. It is composed of 4 elements; the `mainProfile` object is responsible for graphical representation of a physical object inside the simulator; the `selectProfile` is responsible for controlling the physical object that is currently selected; the `dragProfile` manages the drag behavior of the simulation board; and the `scaleProfile`manages the scaling behavior of the simulation board. The rest of this file contains typical DOM management codes.

# GUI

## Board
The board contains the physical objects and is actually where the simulation happens. It can be dragged or scaled using typical mouse commands.
## Upper Bar
The upper bar, which appears only if a physical object is selected, provides tools for managing different properties of the selected object:
1. Name. The identifier of the object.
2. Material. Graphically, the color of the object, but this property actually defines affects the behavior of the object during a collision or explosion.
3. Mass. The physical mass of the object, which is responsible for the amount of gravitational force that it exerts on other objects.
4. Temperature. The physical temperature of the object, which is responsible for its behavior during a collision.
5. Speed. The speed of the object.
6. Direction. The direction of the object.
7. Origin. An indicator of whether the object is considered as the origin of the coordination system. Only one object can be the origin.
8. Remove Button. It removes the object. 
9. Revert Button. It reverts the object back to its initial status.
10. Close Button. It deselects the object and close the upper bar.

## Lower Bar
The lower bar controls the overall properties of the simulation:
1. Minimize/Maximize Button. It shrinks/grows the lower bar.
2. Fit Button. It moves the board so that all the objects fit inside the window.
3. Load Button. It loads a JSON file that contains a simulation state.
4. Save Button. It creates a JSON file that contains the current simulation state.
5. Add Button. It adds a new object to the simulation.
6. Restart Button. It clears the board and removes all the objects.
7. Play/Pause Button. It starts/pauses the simulation.
8. Playback Rate Slider. It controls the simulation speed.
9. Scale Slider. It controls the size of the board.
10. Trajectory Tick. It specifies if the trajectories of the object must be visible or not.
11. Guides Tick. It specifies if the properties of the selected object must be visible or not.
12. Explosion Tick. It specifies if an explosion can occur in the case of a collision or not.
